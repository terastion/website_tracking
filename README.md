# Website Tracking
This repository contains a webpage I wrote for an assignment for my Introduction to Computer Security class. For the assignment, I had to set up a web server with an SSL certificate, PHP, and MySQL, as well as create a MySQL database.

The purpose of these webpages is to track unique visitors to the website using specific attributes (cookies, IP address, window size, user agent, whether cookies are enabled, fonts installed, and whether JavaScript is enabled). The attributes are then written to a MySQL database.

In order to test the webpage, I ran `duplicate.sh`, which creates 500 numbered copies of `track.html`. These would then subsequently be visited by a fleet of random visitors generated by the website for my class.

## Steps
**Step 2** contains a webpage that sends a POST request to `track.php` containing only the page visited. It serves as a preliminary step in the assignment to ensure that page visits can lead to SQL database entries.

**Step 3** contains a webpage that sends the same POST request, but with all of the attributes sent in the POST request.
